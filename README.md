# WorkHours-testing_site

###Project Description
This product plans to be a project management mobile friendly webapp for commercial application. 
The product will allow users to enter project information, and see whether it is possible to implement that project.
The interface will visually display capacity (or lack of) and allow the user to decide whether it is or is not possible to take on a project
based on the number of workhours the project will take, and the days the project has to be completed.

* Project title

* Project Start Date
* Project Deadline
* Project Category (e.g. ICE, NDY-Dubai, NDY-Sydney, etc.)
* Total Workhours Estimate
* Daily Workhours On Project (Calculated from inputs)
